# Path planning using Djikstra algorithm and A* 



## Description

Mobile robots have seen significant development over the years. Path planning in predictable or static environ- ments have largely been solved, while dynamic environments pose significant practical challenges. This project looks to add a possible development path of a hybrid approach. The agent progressing through the environment will stick to an initial path generated from the global frame by central computation. Then, the path will be recalculated only when an obstacle is close and interfering with the current path. Once past the interfering obstacle, the agent will reconnect with the original path. This hopes to distribute the computation burden between the central computer and agent which will free up some energy on the agent and less central management
